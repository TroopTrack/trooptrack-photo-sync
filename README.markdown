# trooptrack photo sync

A desktop app for downloading all your troop photos to your hard drive.

In the future, we can make this a way to upload and even syncronize between desktop and trooptrack's photo repository.

## build and run

This is Elm running in electron. To build, you're going to need node.

After you checkout the repo, install node. Then:

```
$> npm install
$> npm run install-elm
$> npm run watch-elm
```

This will make Elm available in your project. You can also install Elm globally to make it easier to use from the
command line:

```
$> npm install elm -g
```

To run the app, open a new console:

```
$> npm start
```
